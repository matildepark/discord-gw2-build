# Guild Wars 2 - Buildbot

Handy little gyro that gives a quick report on your character's build in your Discord channel by prompting the [Guild Wars 2 API](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main). Persistently stores your API key locally, DMs you if it has nothing on file.

## Example
```
matilde: !build Blorra Incalculable
Function Gyro: Blorra Incalculable
Function Gyro: Radiance: Healer's Retribution, Retribution, Amplified Wrath
Function Gyro: Firebrand: Archivist of Whispers, Loremaster, Stalwart Speed
Function Gyro: Virtues: Master of Consecrations, Glacial Heart, Permeating Wrath
```
